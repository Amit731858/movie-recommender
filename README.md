# Movie Recommendation System
This project is a simple, interactive movie recommendation system built using Streamlit and Python. It uses a content-based filtering approach to suggest movies that are similar to a selected one.

The application leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie posters, providing a visual and engaging user experience.
